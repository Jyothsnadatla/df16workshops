Introduction
-------------

In this project, you learn how to build an application on App Cloud from start to finish, without writing any code. If you're new to App Cloud, the goal is to introduce you to the basics of app building. These point-and-click skills apply whether or not you plan to write code on the platform. If you're familiar with the App Cloud Admin features—managing users and security, customizing standard objects, and so on—the goal is to apply those skills to developing new applications. You need a Developer Edition org to complete this project. If you don't have one, you can sign up here.
You will build a suggestion management app that allows employees to submit suggestions and track their status using these steps.
Create the app definition and a data model for the application. This simple application requires only one custom object.
Modify the user interface on the browser and on Salesforce1 Mobile using page layouts, compact layouts, and global actions.
Automate calculations, data quality, and database updates to improve the user experience using formulas, validation rules, and a process builder.
Define reports, charts, and dashboards to track the status of suggestions and analyze how well the company manages suggestions.
