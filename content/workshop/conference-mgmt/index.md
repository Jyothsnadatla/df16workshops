title = "Build a Conference Management App using Lightning"

+++

## Introduction
In this project, you learn how to build an application from start to finish using the Lightning framework for the Lightning Experience desktop UI and the Salesforce1 mobile app. We will build an app to manage sessions and speakers at a conference. We will build the UI and also automate tasks for Conference Management, using a Salesforce Developer Edition org. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

Here are the steps involved:

* Create the Data Model using the Schema Builder
* Create a New Speaker Form Lightning Component
* Create a Session list Lightning Component
* Write an Apex class for Components client-side
* Use the Lightning App Builder to buil the App with the newly created components
* Add the app to Salesforce1 and Lightning Experience
* Configure time-based actions using Lightning Process Builder
* Build an Apex Trigger to handle advanced tasks.
* Test the App using Apex unit tests

### Step 1: Create the Data Model

#### What you'll do
You will create custom sObjects for Sessions, Speakers and Session Speaker associations quickly using the Schema Builder.
