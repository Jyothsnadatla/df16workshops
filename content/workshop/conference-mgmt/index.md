title = "Build a Conference Management App using Lightning"

+++

## Introduction
In this project, you learn how to build an application from start to finish using the Lightning framework for the Lightning Experience desktop UI and the Salesforce1 mobile app. We will build an app to manage sessions and speakers at a conference. We will build the UI and also automate tasks for Conference Management, using a Salesforce Developer Edition org. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

Here are the steps involved:

* Create the Data Model using the Schema Builder
* Creating a New Speaker Form Lightning Component
* Create a Session list Lightning Component
* Write an Apex class for Components client-side
* Create the Conference Management App using the Lightning App Builder
* Add the app to Salesforce1 and Lightning Experience
* Configure time-based actions using Lightning Process Builder
* Build an Apex Trigger to handle advanced tasks.
